This is a day 33 of 100 days of python project, i decided to upload it as unlike the course would want me to i did this in OOP, i didnt look at the tutorial so im sure the code is very wacky, however it does make me feel a bit proud as this project is very cool to me :)
This project consists of 4 files, 3 of them being classes which we import into main, make sure that you open these classes and update the variables with your coordinates and to update the email keys to email you in order for this to work for you :)
